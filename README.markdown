This repo is the code for [Seabirds.net](http://seabirds.net) 
is the website of the World Seabird Union, an umbrella organisation focused on seabird research. 

It is a fairly standard Django application. Feel free to contribute by forking
the code and commenting on issues.

## Setup

```
sudo apt-get install libpg-dev postgresql
sudo apt-get install libfreetype6 libfreetype6-dev
sudo apt-get install libjpeg8 libjpeg8-dev
mkvirtualenv seabirds
```

Now fix Ubuntu paths to conform to PIL's weird setup assumption
([more detail](https://gist.github.com/1901496)):
```
sudo ln -s /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libfreetype.so /usr/lib/
sudo ln -s /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libz.so /usr/lib/
sudo ln -s /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libjpeg.so /usr/lib/
```

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
sudo su postgres
psql template1
```

At the `template1=#` prompt:
```
CREATE USER [your username] CREATEDB;
CREATE USER seabirds;
```

Why?
* The user you develop under needs to be able to create databases.
* The seabirds user has a number of permissions assigned to it when loading
  a database dump from the production server.

Go back to your login, and ensure your public ssh key is in the
authorised_keys of the server you are deploying to. Then run:
```
fab get_live_database # Download live db and load it locally
fab get_live_media    # Download all the media assets
fab get_secrets       # Get API keys etc and example sitesettings.py
```

Don't worry if you get an error `ERROR:  must be member of role "seabirds"`,
that's just because the table belongs to you instead of the seabirds user.

`get_secrets` will place the production sitesettings.py in a file
`sitesettings_production.py`. You can create your own custom settings in
`seabirds/sitesettings.py` which might look something like this:

```python
# Settings for seabirds.net
DEBUG = True

DATABASES = {
    'default': {
        'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.postgresql_psycopg2',
        'NAME': 'seabirds',
        'USER': 'your username',
        'HOST': 'localhost',
    }
}
```

Lastly, you may wish to modify [your site model's domain](http://localhost:8000/admin/sites/site/)
from seabirds.net to localhost:8000. Otherwise certain URLs generated by Django may
link to the live site (e.g. generated comment urls).
